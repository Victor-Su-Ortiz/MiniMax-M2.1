      "Got it, let's try to figure this out step by step. First, let's list the initial state: Left bank (L): Farmer (F), Wolf (W), Goat (G), Cabbage (C). Right bank (R): Empty. The boat can carry F plus one other thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, we need to avoid leaving W and G alone together, or G and C alone together. Let's start:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. First trip: F takes G to R (since if F takes W first, then L has W and C, but wait no—wait if F takes W first, L has W and C? No, initial L is F, W, G, C. If F takes W to R, then L has G and C—oh, that's bad (G would eat C). So can't take W first. If F takes C first, L has W and G—bad (W eats G). So first trip must be F takes G to R. So after trip 1: L: W, C; R: F, G; boat at R.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Trip 2: F leaves G at R and goes back alone to L. So now L: F, W, C; R: G; boat at L.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Trip 3: Now L has F, W, C—wait no, but if F takes W to R, then L has C alone, which is fine, and R has F, G, W—wait no, but wait when F takes W to R, what's the state on R? R has G and W—wait that's bad! Oh right, so trip 3 can't be taking W. So instead, trip 3: F takes C to R (since L has F, W, C—if F takes C, then L has F and W, which is fine). Wait wait let's correct trip 2: After trip 1, R has G, so F goes back alone (trip 2). Now L: F, W, C; R: G. So now, from L, F needs to take either W or C to R. But if F takes W to R, R has G and W—bad. So F takes C to R (trip 3). So after trip 3: L: F, W; R: F, G, C; boat at R.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait no, wait trip 3: F takes C from L to R. So L after trip 3: W (since F took C to R, so L was F, W, C—take C, so L has W; R has G, C, F). Now, what's the state on R? R has G and C—oh, that's bad! Oh right, I messed up. Wait no—wait trip 3: F is at L (after trip 2), so to go from L to R, he takes either W or C. If he takes C, then R has G and C (from trip 1) plus C—so G and C are together on R, which is bad. Oh! So that's a mistake. Wait then trip 3 must be taking W, but then R has G and W—bad. Wait did I do trip 2 wrong? Wait trip 1: F takes G to R (correct). Trip 2: F leaves G at R, goes back alone (correct). Now L has F, W, C; R has G. Now, if F takes C to R, R has G and C—bad. If F takes W to R, R has G and W—bad. Wait but we need to get rid of G from R so that when we bring something else, G isn't there. Oh wait! Wait trip 2: After trip 1, F takes G to R (R has G), then instead of going back alone—wait no, the boat can only carry F and one item. So trip 2 has to be F alone, because if he takes G back, he's back to start. Oh right, so trip 2 is F alone back to L. Now, here's the key: When F is at R with G (trip 1), he needs to leave G at R and go back (trip 2), but then, to fix the problem that taking W or C to R would leave G with W or C, he needs to take the other item (whichever isn't bad with G) but wait no—wait wait no, wait trip 1: F takes G to R (R has G). Then trip 2: F comes back alone (L has F, W, C; R has G). Now, trip 3: F takes either W or C to R, but whichever he takes, R has G and the new one—bad. Wait but wait, no—wait wait, did I misremember the problem? Let's go back: The problem says \"If left alone: The wolf will eat the goat; The goat will eat the cabbage\". So it's only when left alone—so if the farmer is there, it's okay. So trip 1: F takes G to R (R has F, G). Then F leaves G at R and goes back alone (trip 2: F back to L). Now L has F, W, C. Now, trip 3: F takes W to R (so R has F, G, W—wait no, but when F takes W to R, what's the state on R? R has G and W, but F is there? Wait wait no! Wait when F takes W to R, he arrives at R, so now R has F, G, W—oh! Because F is on R now. Oh! I made a mistake earlier—when you transport someone, the farmer is on the boat, so when he arrives at R, he is there, so the \"alone\" part is when the farmer is not there. Oh my god, that's the key mistake. So let's correct that. Let's re-express each trip with F's position:\n",

      "Oh! That's the correct sequence! I messed up earlier by not considering that when Farmer takes something to R, he is present there, so the \"alone\" part is only when he is not present. So let's verify each step for safety:\n",

      "1. Step 1: L has W, C (no F, but W and C are safe). R has F, G (safe). Good.\n",

      "7. Step 7: All on R, safe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes! That's the correct sequence. The key mistake I made earlier was not realizing that when Farmer takes an item to R, he is present there, so the \"alone\" rule only applies when he is not there. So the critical steps are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. First take Goat (since taking Wolf or Cabbage first would leave Goat with the other).\n",
      "2. Return alone.\n",
      "3. Take Wolf to R (leaving Cabbage alone on L, which is safe).\n",

      "7. Take Goat to R (all on R).\n",

      "Let's confirm each step again to be 100%:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Step 1: F + G → R (L: W, C; R: F, G) → Good (W+C safe, F+G safe).\n",
      "- Step 2: F ← R (L: F, W, C; R: G) → Good (F+W+C safe, G alone safe).\n",
      "- Step 3: F + W → R (L: C; R: F, G, W) → Good (C alone safe, F+G+W safe).\n",

      "- Step 5: F + C → R (L: G; R: F, W, C) → Good (G alone safe, F+W+C safe).\n",
      "- Step 6: F ← R (L: F, G; R: W, C) → Good (F+G safe, W+C alone safe).\n",
      "- Step 7: F + G → R (L: empty; R: all) → Good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perfect! All steps are safe. The key insight is realizing that you have to take the Goat first, then the Wolf, bring the Goat back, take the Cabbage, bring the Goat back, then take the Goat again. That's the classic solution to the farmer, wolf, goat, cabbage problem.\n",
      "</think>\n",
      "\n",
      "To solve this classic problem, the farmer must **avoid leaving the wolf and goat together** (wolf eats goat) or **the goat and cabbage together** (goat eats cabbage).
