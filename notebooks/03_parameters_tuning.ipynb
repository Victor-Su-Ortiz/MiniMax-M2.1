      "\n",
      "At their core, computers are remarkably simple machines that perform complex tasks through the interaction of basic components. Understanding how computers work means understanding both the physical hardware that makes up a computer and the logical systems that tell that hardware what to do. Despite the apparent complexity of modern computers—from smartphones to supercomputers—all computers operate on the same fundamental principles established nearly a century ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "## The Binary Foundation\n",
      "\n",
      "Before diving into computer components, it's essential to understand the language computers speak. Unlike humans who use a decimal system (base-10) with digits 0 through 9, computers use binary (base-2), which only has two digits: 0 and 1. Every piece of information in a computer—whether it's a document, a photograph, a song, or the instructions telling the computer what to do—is represented as sequences of these two values.\n",
      "\n",
      "This binary system works beautifully with computer hardware because the fundamental building blocks of electronics are switches that exist in one of two states: on or off. A binary 1 typically represents \"on\" (electricity flowing), while a binary 0 represents \"off\" (no electricity flowing). By combining millions or billions of these tiny switches, computers can represent and manipulate enormous amounts of information.\n",
      "\n",
      "The power of binary representation lies in its reliability. It's much easier to distinguish between \"some electricity\" and \"no electricity\" than to measure precise voltage levels representing ten different digits. This simple foundation enables the remarkable precision and speed of modern computing.\n",

It was annoyance. Annoyance at the water spots on the mirror, at the particular way the morning sun caught the dust motes drifting through the cracked window, at the memory of the dream she'd had again, the one where she walked through her own house calling out names that had no faces attached to them. It was only when she lowered the toothbrush and watched her doubled image in the glass remain frozen, mouth full of foam, hand suspended mid-stroke, that the silence in her head became the loudest thing she'd ever heard. And even then—even as her heart began its frantic percussion against her ribs—she noticed, with the strange detachment of someone watching their own life become someone else's, that her reflection's eyes were open.

      "| **Solar variability** | Changes in solar irradiance (the “solar constant”) of ~0.1 % over an 11‑year cycle. | Adds ~0.04 W m⁻² to the Earth’s energy budget, compared to the ~2 W m⁻² net positive forcing from human emissions. |\n",
      "| **Volcanic eruptions** | Injection of sulfate aerosols into the stratosphere → temporary cooling (e.g., Pinatubo 1991). | Typically < 0.1 W m⁻² cooling for a few years; does not counteract long‑term warming. |\n",
      "| **Ocean‑atmosphere variability** (e.g., El Niño‑Southern Oscillation, Pacific Decadal Oscillation) | Alters heat distribution and cloud patterns. | Contributes to year‑to‑year temperature swings but not a sustained upward trend. |\n",
      "| **Milankovitch cycles** (slow changes in Earth’s orbit) | Influence glacial‑interglacial cycles over tens of thousands of years. | Not relevant for the rapid climate change observed in the past century. |\n",
      "| **Biogeochemical feedbacks** (e.g., release of CO₂ from permafrost) | Thaw of frozen soils releases stored carbon. | Amplifies the warming already caused by human emissions. |\n",

      "| Feedback | How it works |\n",
      "|----------|--------------|\n",
      "| **Water‑vapor feedback** | Warmer air holds more water vapor (itself a potent GHG), which traps more heat. |\n",
      "| **Ice‑albedo feedback** | Melting ice reduces surface reflectivity, exposing darker ocean or land that absorbs more sunlight. |\n",
      "| **Permafrost carbon release** | Thawing permafrost releases stored organic carbon as CO₂ and CH₄. |\n",
      "| **Methane clathrate destabilization** | Warming of deep ocean sediments may release large amounts of methane hydrates. |\n",
      "| **Vegetation changes** | Shifts in forest cover can alter carbon sequestration capacity (often net‑positive for emissions). |\n",
      "\n",
      "These feedbacks can multiply the direct radiative forcing by a factor of roughly 1.5–2, making the climate system more sensitive than the initial human emissions alone would suggest.\n",

      "2. **Amplifying feedbacks** (water vapor, ice melt, permafrost thaw, vegetation shifts).  \n",
      "3. **Minor natural influences** (solar cycles, volcanic activity, internal climate variability) that act on top of the dominant anthropogenic signal.\n",
